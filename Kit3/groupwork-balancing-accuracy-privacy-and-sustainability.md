# Groupwork: Balancing Accuracy, Privacy, and Sustainability

## **Prep**

This groupwork exercise utilizes the gallery walk instructional strategy. The purpose of this exercise is for students to apply what they have learned about creating ethical AI in a life-like scenario that involves a recommender system. Through participating in the exercise, students can also improve their critical thinking skills, empathy for different perspectives, and communication skills.

### Materials Checklist:

* Chart papers or whiteboards.
* &#x20;Markers in multiple colors.
* Printed stakeholder descriptions.
* Timer or stopwatch for keeping track of rotation times.

### Preparation of the Room:

* Arrange the classroom to accommodate three stations, ideally at equal distances. Ensure there’s enough space for students to gather and discuss at each.
* Print or have available digital copies of the scenario and stakeholder descriptions for reference at each station.
* Mark each station with one of the three stakeholder titles:
  * Building Manager (Accuracy)
  * Environmentalist (Sustainability)
  * Privacy Advocate (Privacy)
* Ensure each station has chart paper or a whiteboard for students to write down their improvements.

## Teaching Notes

### **Overview**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="178"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td>In this next exercise, you will consider the perspectives of three key stakeholders in the implementation of a ML-powered room occupancy monitor. Each stakeholder has a focus on either the accuracy, privacy, or sustainability elements of room occupancy monitoring systems. The goal is to collaboratively find a balanced solution that incorporates all three principles in the design and implementation of the monitoring system. By participating actively, considering different perspectives, and engaging in constructive dialogue, you will gain insights into the real-world challenges of implementing ML technologies responsibly.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Students to read the instructions for the exercise.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Split students into three groups (one group for each of the three principles – accuracy, privacy, and sustainability).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Students to go with their group to their starting station.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Students to read through the scenario, stakeholder profiles, and the content on the three principles.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Brainstorming (students work at their stakeholder’s station)**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="175"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to deliberate and come up with two recommendations for improving the room occupancy monitoring system primarily in line with their stakeholder’s interests.</td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Give students 20 minutes to brainstorm and come up with their recommendations.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Rotations (students move around to the other stations and provide feedback)**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="172"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td><p>Students to rotate to the next station and do the following:</p><ul><li>Read the previous group’s recommendations</li><li>Discuss it from their stakeholder’s perspective</li><li>Write constructive feedback on the previous group’s recommendations</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 10 minutes to work at the new station.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Students to rotate to the next station and follow the previous steps.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td><p>While students are working, move around the room and ensure groups are engaged and adhering to the exercise’s objective.</p><p> </p><p>Assist groups that might be struggling with formulating recommendations or feedback. Encourage groups to put themselves in the shoes of their assigned stakeholder and consider what they might be willing to give up, as well as what is most important to them.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td><p><em>[Use the following information to help groups that are struggling]</em></p><p> </p><p>Sustainability Advocates:</p><ul><li><strong>What they might be willing to give up:</strong> While sustainability advocates highly value eco-friendly solutions, they might be open to certain compromises if they recognize tangible efforts toward energy efficiency or reduced environmental impact.</li><li><strong>What is most important to them:</strong> For sustainability advocates, the environment's well-being is paramount. Their primary focus is on reducing the school’s ecological footprint, promoting energy efficiency, and ensuring responsible resource use. Any proposed solution should align with these sustainability goals.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Privacy Advocates:</p><ul><li><strong>What they might be willing to give up:</strong> Privacy advocates understand the importance of accurate data but may be willing to explore anonymized or aggregated data collection methods to strike a balance between accuracy and individual privacy. </li><li><strong>What is most important to them:</strong> Privacy advocates prioritize protecting occupants' personal data and ensuring data security. They are keen on implementing robust privacy safeguards, such as data encryption and user consent mechanisms, to maintain occupant trust and privacy rights.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Accuracy Advocates:</p><ul><li><strong>What they might be willing to give up:</strong> While accuracy advocates value precise data for efficient school building management, they may consider flexible data collection intervals or adaptive algorithms to accommodate concerns related to privacy or energy consumption.</li><li><strong>What is most important to them:</strong> Accuracy advocates are committed to leveraging accurate data for informed decision-making. They emphasize real-time monitoring and reliable data analytics to optimize resource allocation and school building performance.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Group Reflection**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="155"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Once all rotations are complete, direct groups back to their initial stations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Students to read through the feedback they received, discuss how to modify their recommendations accordingly, and prepare a short presentation based on their modified recommendations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 15 minutes to modify their initial recommendations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Each group to present their modified recommendations to the rest of the class.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Reflection and Debrief**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="160"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>How did you find the process of balancing the concerns of accuracy, privacy, and sustainability?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 10 minutes to respond to the question, allowing at least one student from each group to share their responses.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td>Which compromises were most commonly agreed upon among groups? Were there any innovative solutions that you hadn't considered before?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 10 minutes to respond to the question, allowing at least one student from each group to share their responses.</td></tr></tbody></table>
