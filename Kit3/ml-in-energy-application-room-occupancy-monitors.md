# ML in Energy Application: Room Occupancy Monitors

Buildings are major consumers of energy, accounting for approximately 40% of global electricity usage, which translates to more than 30% of global CO2 emissions \[[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921001409)], \[[65](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377027)]. The energy required to regulate indoor conditions in buildings contributes significantly to overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions \[[66](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/17/3254)]. Therefore, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings is crucial for reducing global energy consumption \[[66](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/17/3254)], \[[67](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362644322_Machine_Learning_Deep_Learning_and_Statistical_Analysis_for_forecasting_building_energy_consumption_-A_systematic_review)].

A method for making buildings more energy efficient is to monitor room occupancy using ML \[[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546822000441)], \[[22](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full)]. By learning occupancy patterns, ML can be used to more accurately determine when a room is occupied \[[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546822000441)], \[[67](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362644322_Machine_Learning_Deep_Learning_and_Statistical_Analysis_for_forecasting_building_energy_consumption_-A_systematic_review)]. A building’s indoor conditions can then be adapted according to the ML model’s predictions \[[13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546822000441)], \[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778821007623)], \[[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616)]. For example, when a room is predicted to be unoccupied, the lights can be turned off \[[27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778821007623)], \[[29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616)]. Educational buildings are a great candidate for this technology as they tend to have significant energy demands \[[65](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377027)]. By utilizing a ML-powered room occupancy monitor, educational buildings can greatly decrease their energy consumption \[[65](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377027)], \[[67](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362644322_Machine_Learning_Deep_Learning_and_Statistical_Analysis_for_forecasting_building_energy_consumption_-A_systematic_review)].

Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind the privacy and sustainability issues that can arise when integrated ML in energy. Even though this technology is aimed at reducing energy consumption, it may have issues of its own. Try to keep these in mind as you work through the activity below.

## Identifying occupancy: Think-Pair-Share <a href="#toc864981819" id="toc864981819"></a>

### Overview <a href="#toc1672856616" id="toc1672856616"></a>

In this activity, you will work on identifying methods for identifying room occupancy.&#x20;

### 1. Think <a href="#toc2031504130" id="toc2031504130"></a>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Picture12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On your own, think about potential methods for identifying if a room is empty or occupied. Write down answers to the following questions:

* What kinds of sensors would be required?
* How would the data differ between empty and occupied rooms?&#x20;

### 2. Pair <a href="#toc1758720102" id="toc1758720102"></a>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Picture13.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Find a partner, discuss your answers and agree on a common solution to identify room occupancy.

### &#x20;3. Share
