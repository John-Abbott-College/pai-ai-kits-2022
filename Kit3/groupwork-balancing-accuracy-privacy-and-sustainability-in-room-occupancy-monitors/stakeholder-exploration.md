### Aim

In this exercise, you will consider the perspectives of three key stakeholders in the implementation of a ML-powered room occupancy monitor. Each stakeholder has a focus on either the accuracy, privacy, or sustainability elements of room occupancy monitoring systems. The goal is to collaboratively find a balanced solution that incorporates all three principles in the design and implementation of the monitoring system. By participating actively, considering different perspectives, and engaging in constructive dialogue, you will gain insights into the real-world challenges of implementing ML technologies responsibly.

### Building Details

The building in question is a multi-story school building located in a bustling urban area. It was built approximately 30 years ago, making it a prominent institution with a history of providing education to the community. The school stands at three stories tall and comprises a total of 40 individual classrooms, a library, a gymnasium, a cafeteria, and administrative offices.

### Student and Staff Demographics

Currently, the school educates a diverse group of students from various backgrounds and lifestyles. The student population ranges from kindergarteners to middle school students, contributing to a dynamic and inclusive learning environment. The teaching and non-teaching staff include young educators, seasoned professionals, and support staff, adding richness to the institution's makeup.

### Occupancy Patterns

Occupancy patterns within the school vary throughout the day and week. During weekdays, classrooms are bustling with activity during regular school hours, with peaks during morning assembly and recess times. After school, some classrooms and shared spaces like the library or gymnasium may still be occupied due to extracurricular activities or staff meetings. On weekends, the building might see reduced occupancy, except during special events or community activities.

### Stakeholder Exploration

#### School Budget Manager - Malik Williams (Prioritizes Accuracy)

* Malik Williams is a diligent school budget manager with a relentless drive to optimize the school's finances. While he's aware of the ongoing discussions about privacy and sustainability in the education sector, his primary focus remains on sustainable cost-saving measures. He is particularly invested in the adoption of ML-powered room occupancy monitors in the school. For Malik, the financial benefits of these devices, which can detect room vacancy and automate energy adjustments, outweigh the broader debates. While he acknowledges the importance of privacy and long-term sustainability, his immediate mission is to ensure the school’s financial health, believing that a well-funded educational environment can address other concerns more effectively.

#### School Sustainability Coordinator - Aisha Patel (Prioritizes Sustainability)

* Aisha Patel is the dedicated Sustainability Coordinator at the school, driven solely by her unwavering commitment to eco-friendliness. While she acknowledges the benefits of ML-powered room occupancy monitors in energy efficiency, Aisha is particularly concerned about the environmental implications of relentlessly pursuing more accurate but potentially less sustainable designs. She consistently champions the adoption of technologies that prioritize sustainability over sheer precision. For Aisha, every decision, from classroom materials to energy systems, should be assessed through the lens of its environmental impact. Her mission is to ensure the school becomes a model of uncompromising environmental responsibility.

#### Concerned Parent - Mei Chen (Prioritizes Privacy)

* Mei Chen, an active parent within the school community, is a staunch advocate for student and family privacy. While she understands the school's efforts to implement ML-powered room occupancy monitors for reasons of efficiency and sustainability, Mei's primary concern revolves around potential privacy implications. She believes that the protection of individual privacy should always take precedence over technological accuracy or even sustainability goals. For Mei, the idea of continuous monitoring, even in the interest of energy conservation or space optimization, raises significant questions about data usage and the boundaries of surveillance within educational institutions. She consistently engages with the school board and other parents, emphasizing the paramount importance of safeguarding the privacy of every student and their families.

In the discussion, Malik will emphasize the importance of accurate data for school budget optimization, while Aisha, as the Sustainability Coordinator, will champion eco-friendly approaches within the school environment. Mei, as a concerned parent, will prioritize ensuring that robust privacy measures are implemented. The challenge will be for these individuals to collaborate and find a solution that harmoniously integrates sustainability, privacy, and accuracy principles in the room occupancy monitoring system.
