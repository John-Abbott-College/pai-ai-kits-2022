# Scenario

A ML-powered room occupancy monitor is planned to be installed in a school, where occupancy patterns within the school vary throughout the day and week.

## Instructions

### 1. Group Up

You will be divided into teams. Each team will start at one of the following stakeholder stations:

* **School Budget Manager - Malik Williams** _(Prioritizes Accuracy)_
* **School Sustainability Coordinator - Aisha Patel** _(Prioritizes Sustainability)_
* **Concerned Parent - Mei Chen** _(Prioritizes Privacy)_

### 2. Familiarize Yourself

Review the scenario and stakeholder profiles to gain a comprehensive understanding of the monitoring system's intended setting and the viewpoints of each stakeholder.

### 3. Brainstorm at Your Station

1. Begin at your assigned station.
2. As a team, brainstorm two suggestions for improving the room occupancy monitor, aligning with the stakeholder's priority.
3. Appoint one member to write down your group's suggestion clearly on the chart paper or whiteboard.

### 4. Rotate to the Next Station

1. After the allocated time, move to the next station in sequence.
2. Start by carefully reading the recommendation provided by the previous group.
3. Discuss the suggestion among yourselves, considering both its strengths and potential pitfalls.
4. After your discussion, write down your feedback on the same chart paper or whiteboard.
5. Your feedback should address:
   * Aspects of the suggestion you find effective and why.
   * Potential challenges or oversights in the suggestion.
   * Any refinements or additions you believe would strengthen the recommendation.

### 5. Continue Rotating

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your team has visited and provided feedback at all three stations.

### 6. Reflect and Refine

1. Return to your initial station and review the feedback your recommendation received.
2. As a team, discuss the comments and decide on any changes you'd make to your original suggestion based on the feedback.

### 7. Class Discussion

* Once all rotations are completed, we'll reconvene for a shared conversation.
* Each group will present their refined recommendation and share reflections on the feedback process.
* Be prepared to discuss the complexities of the stakeholder viewpoint you started with and the insights you gained from others.

**Note:** Remember, this exercise is as much about paying attention and understanding others as it is about suggesting your own ideas. The goal isn't to "win" but to collaboratively work towards an ethical and balanced recommender system. Approach each station with an open mind and respect for diverse perspectives.
