# Evaluate the Ethics of ML

## **Accuracy**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="173"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td>Anyone involved in the development or deployment of ML must be mindful of the impact they can have. As we learned earlier, ML technologies have the potential to cause harm. To avoid doing harm, ML must be developed and deployed with ethical principles in mind. Let’s start off by exploring the principle of accuracy and its importance in reducing harm that can be caused by ML.  </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td><p>Students to read through the Accuracy section including the sub-sections on:</p><ul><li> Data Quality</li><li>Dangers of ML Inaccuracy</li><li> Improving ML Accuracy</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 10 minutes to read through the content.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Accuracy vs. Sustainability**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="175"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td>Evaluating AI models is not just about how accurate its predictions are. Sustainability also matters a great deal. However, making a ML model more accurate can lead to reduced sustainability due to the increased resource demands and environmental impact [<a href="https://futurium.ec.europa.eu/en/european-ai-alliance/blog/sustainable-artificial-intelligence-energy-sector?language=es">32</a>], [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350071340_Automated_prediction_system_of_household_energy_consumption_in_cities_using_web_crawler_and_optimized_artificial_intelligence">48</a>], [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">49</a>].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td><p>Students to read through the section on Accuracy vs. Sustainability including the sub-sections on:</p><ul><li>Factors that make ML more accurate, but less sustainable</li><li>Factors that make ML less accurate, but more sustainable</li><li>Rebound effect</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 5 minutes to read through the content.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Accuracy vs. Privacy**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="163"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td>Similar to the relationship between accuracy and sustainability, making ML more accurate can also make it less private. The tradeoff between accuracy and privacy in machine learning arises due to the tension between maximizing predictive performance and protecting sensitive information [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616">5</a>].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask</strong></td><td><p>Students to read through the section on Accuracy vs. Privacy including the sub-sections on:</p><ul><li>Factors that make ML more accurate, but less private</li><li>Factors that make ML less accurate, but more private</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Do</strong></td><td>Give students 5 to read through the content.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Ethical Principles**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="157"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td><p>For the next sub-activity, we will focus on the principles of accuracy, privacy, and sustainability as they have particular importance in the application of ML in the energy sector. Accuracy involves striving for the highest level of precision and correctness, ensuring reliable and dependable results that align with intended objectives [<a href="https://www.fatml.org/resources/principles-for-accountable-algorithms">50</a>]. Privacy involves safeguarding and respecting the confidentiality of data, emphasizing responsible and secure handling of sensitive information throughout the development and deployment process [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2">51</a>]. Sustainability involves developing systems with a positive and lasting impact on society and the environment, emphasizing responsible resource use to support long-term viability [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2">51</a>].</p><p> </p><p>However, it is important to keep in mind that there may still be other ethical issues at play such as unfairness and a lack of transparency, including others that have not been outlined here.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td><p>While there is no universal set of guidelines or regulations governing ML, certain principles have emerged as crucial in developing ethical ML, including <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong>, to name a few [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2">51</a>]. These principles are important when assessing ML’s impact on the energy sector [<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full">2</a>], [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370580741_AI-Enabled_Energy_Policy_for_a_Sustainable_Future">14</a>]. For instance, ML can create unfair outcomes in energy systems [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>]. ML models learn from historical data, and if the training data is biased, the model will perpetuate that bias in its predictions [<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full">2</a>], [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>]. In the energy sector, historical data may reflect past inequalities or discriminatory practices, leading to biased outcomes [<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full">2</a>], [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>]. If certain groups or communities are underrepresented in the training data, the ML model may not accurately capture their specific needs or energy consumption patterns, resulting in unequal treatment [<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full">2</a>], [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616">5</a>].</p><p> </p><p><strong>Transparency</strong> refers to the clarity and openness in the decision-making process of ML models [<a href="https://medium.com/compendium/https-medium-com-mab-55055-what-is-fatml-and-why-should-you-care-dfb36e51f2f4">53</a>], [<a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4015851/Fate%20In%20AI.pdf">54</a>]. Many ML models can be highly complex and consist of numerous layers and interconnected nodes [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621000548">7</a>], [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>]. As these models become more sophisticated, they often become harder to interpret and understand fully [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621000548">7</a>], [<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full">2</a>], [<a href="https://www.n-ix.com/artificial-intelligence-in-energy/">23</a>], [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>]. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to identify and address potential biases and unfairness in the model's decision-making process [<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2023.1071291/full">2</a>], [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/12/4427">52</a>]. In addition, a lack of transparency can raise <strong>privacy</strong> concerns as individuals may not understand how their data is being used or how the model arrives at its predictions [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621000548">7</a>], [<a href="https://www.energyrev.org.uk/media/1985/energyrev_aiandethics_final_202207.pdf">31</a>], [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9883030">30</a>]. These examples demonstrate how the principles intertwine and reinforce each other. It is therefore best practice to assess the ethics of ML holistically [<a href="https://www.energyrev.org.uk/media/1985/energyrev_aiandethics_final_202207.pdf">31</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616">5</a>].</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
