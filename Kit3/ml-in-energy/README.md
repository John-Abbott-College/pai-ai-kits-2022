## **Issues in the Energy Sector**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="123"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td>The energy sector refers to the industry and infrastructure involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of energy resources [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621000548">7</a>], [<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy/overview">8</a>]. It is the backbone of industrial and economic development, powering manufacturing, transportation, and infrastructure [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621000548">7</a>], [<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/energy_sector.asp">9</a>]. Without energy, essential aspects of life such as heating, cooling, lighting, and communication would be significantly hindered, affecting the well-being of billions worldwide [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020307512">10</a>].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Say</strong></td><td><p>However, there are many issues facing the energy sector.</p><ul><li>Climate change is a significant global challenge, and the energy sector plays a crucial role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921001409">11</a>], [<a href="https://viejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40327-018-0064-7">12</a>]. The burning of fossil fuels, which currently accounts for about 80% of the world's energy production, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and environmental degradation [<a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/stories/fossil-fuels-and-climate-change-the-facts/">13</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546822000441">1</a>].</li><li>Energy consumption worldwide is increasing rapidly, driven by industrial and technological development, as well as population growth [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370580741_AI-Enabled_Energy_Policy_for_a_Sustainable_Future">14</a>], [<a href="https://viejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40327-018-0064-7">12</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616">15</a>]. This rising demand places considerable strain on existing energy systems, which are often outdated and challenging to upgrade due to their complex nature [<a href="https://viejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40327-018-0064-7">12</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121002616">15</a>], [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370580741_AI-Enabled_Energy_Policy_for_a_Sustainable_Future">14</a>].</li><li>Traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), are finite resources and face the challenge of depletion [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370580741_AI-Enabled_Energy_Policy_for_a_Sustainable_Future">14</a>], [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377027">16</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X22002115">17</a>]. As these resources become scarcer and more difficult to extract, there is a need to shift towards renewable and sustainable energy sources to meet growing energy demands while minimizing environmental impacts [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370580741_AI-Enabled_Energy_Policy_for_a_Sustainable_Future">14</a>], [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9377027">16</a>], [<a href="https://www.energyportal.eu/news/intelligent-power-the-ai-approach-to-energy-management/3521/">18</a>].</li><li>Energy security refers to ensuring a reliable and affordable supply of energy resources to meet consumer demands [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959523000644">19</a>], [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544214007725">20</a>].
