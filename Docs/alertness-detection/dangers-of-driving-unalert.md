# Dangers of Distracted Driving

### Distracted driving:

* refers to instances in which a driver's attention is diverted from the road and the tasks necessary for safe driving (Ahangari et al., 2020)
* includes a wide range of distracted behaviour from moments of insufficient attention, such as talking to a passenger (Al-Doori et al., 2021), to a complete lack of attention, such as falling asleep at the wheel ([Ref](https://www.mathworks.com/company/mathworks-stories/ai-determines-driver-drowsiness-in-level-3-autonomous-cars.html))

### _What makes it dangerous?_

Distracted driving is dangerous because it compromises a driver's ability to:&#x20;

* Perceive their surroundings (Kashevnik et al., 2021)
* Make informed decisions (Ahangari et al., 2020)
* Perform effectively behind the wheel (Ahangari et al., 2020)

Driving while unalert increases the likelihood of crashes and driving errors, putting everyone sharing the road in jeopardy (Shajari et al., 2022). In 2021, it is estimated that distracted driving contributed to about 19.7% of fatal collisions in [Canada](https://globalnews.ca/news/9655035/distracted-driving-deaths-ontario/). Around 79% of drivers admit to engaging in distracting activities while driving, with in-vehicle technologies being particularly dangerous, including phones, car consoles, and voice-activated features according to [CAA](https://www.caa.ca/driving-safely/distracted-driving/statistics/). Unalert drivers tend to drift between lanes, disregard traffic signs, and fail to notice pedestrians or cyclists (Shajari et al., 2022).
