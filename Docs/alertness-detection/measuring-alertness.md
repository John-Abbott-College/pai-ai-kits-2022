### Distraction is subjective&#x20;

Distraction is a multifaceted state that cannot be fully captured by just one type of data (Vismaya & Saritha, 2020). What distracts one person may not distract another.&#x20;

## Data Types

There are four types of data used to study distracted driving, each type has its **advantages** and **limitations** (Vismaya & Saritha, 2020).&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Behavioural" %}
Visual data depicting position and movement of different body parts of drivers (Shajari et al., 2022)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Self-assessment" %}
Data collected from self-report questionnaires or surveys that ask drivers to reflect on their driving behaviour and engagement in distracting activities (Aksjonov et al., 2019)&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Physiological" %}
Data collected through sensors placed on drivers' bodies including heart rate, brain activity, breathing rate, skin temperature, and eye movement (Aksjonov et al., 2019)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Performance" %}
Data that are obtained indirectly from the driver by assessing their vehicle-related actions such as brake and steering behaviour (Aksjonov et al., 2019; Shajari et al., 2022)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

<summary>Learn More - Advantages &#x26; Disadvantages of Each Data Type</summary>

Each type of data has its advantages and disadvantages (Vismaya & Saritha, 2020). For instance, data collected from self-assessment questionnaires can offer valuable insights, but they are based on drivers’ personal opinions and the subjectivity of this measure can lessen its reliability (Shajari et al., 2022). Likewise, physiological data, although valuable to the study of distracted driving, are susceptible to interference from various factors such as drivers’ muscle movements (Shajari et al., 2022).&#x20;

Distraction is a multifaceted state that cannot be fully captured by just one type of data (Vismaya & Saritha, 2020). Most activities that divert a driver’s attention from the road and the task of driving tend to involve multiple, if not all, types of distraction simultaneously (Ahangari et al., 2020). For instance, texting creates concurrent manual, visual, and cognitive distractions (Ahangari et al., 2020). To add to this complexity, the four types of data - performance, physiological, behavioral, and self-assessment - may not always align with each other. For example, a driver may feel fully focused on the road despite exhibiting behavioral signs of distraction. This discrepancy would result in a misalignment between the behavioral data collected from the driver and their self-assessment data. &#x20;

Alternatively, a driver can experience cognitive distraction without it being evident in their driving performance or detectable through physiological measures. This exemplifies the subjective and complex nature of distraction. Current methods lack the capability to fully comprehend and identify the complexities involved. The state of distraction is inherently unique to each person, as what may distract one individual might not have the same effect on another. This subjectivity presents challenges when attempting to study or measure distraction accurately.&#x20;
