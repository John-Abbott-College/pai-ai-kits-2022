# Part 1: Train a Machine Learning Model

With a partner, complete the following steps:&#x20;

### Step 1

Go to the[ ](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train)[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train) website and start an Image Project and choose the standard image model option. &#x20;

### Step 2

Add the following classes:&#x20;

1. Heads-up (looking at the road)&#x20;
2. Heads-down (looking at a phone, for example)&#x20;

### Step 3

Add photos to each class.  &#x20;

You can upload existing photos or take pictures using a webcam. &#x20;

If you feel comfortable, upload your data to your class repository. Your teacher will use this data and combine it with other data to make a more accurate model.&#x20;

To add to your model, try to find datasets on Kaggle or roboflow. There are open datasets available, such as the [Driver Monitoring Dataset](https://dmd.vicomtech.org/#about), for you to use.&#x20;

### Step 4

Train the model and test it.&#x20;

Training happens on the browser
{% endhint %}

### Step 5

Find another student in class to test the model on.&#x20;

### Step 6

Export your model.&#x20;
