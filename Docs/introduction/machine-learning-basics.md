While machine learning has demonstrated remarkable potential, it is not without its challenges and concerns.&#x20;

## Bias in AI

> <mark style="color:red;">“</mark><mark style="color:red;">**Bias**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">is a prejudice for or against something or somebody, that may result in unfair decisions.” (European Commission, 2018)</mark>

Humans are known to exhibit bias in their decisions, and since AI systems are created by humans, there is a possibility of unintentionally injecting bias into them (European Commission, 2018). This is especially true in AI systems that rely on machine learning techniques and the collection and selection of training data (European Commission, 2018).&#x20;

If the **training data** is not **diverse** and **balanced**, the system may learn to make unfair decisions (European Commission, 2018). When AI systems are applied to scenarios involving people, biases related to shapes, colors, skin color, or gender can arise ([Ref](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teach-and-assess/classroom-resources/lesson-ideas/data-bias-in-ai/)). These biases present ethical concerns as AI systems can reinforce and amplify existing biases, and their decision-making process may be difficult to understand or question due to their complex nature (Shaw, 2019).&#x20;

<summary>Learn More - Bias &#x26; Manipulation in AI</summary>

_How Normal Am I?_ was made by Tijmen Schep - an artist, technology critic, and privacy advocate - with the aim of provoking people to question the reliability of facial recognition systems and AI more broadly ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). &#x20;

_“If you have a low score, it might just be because the judgment of these algorithms is so dependent on how they were trained” -_ Tijmen Schep ([Ref](https://www.techjuice.pk/this-eu-funded-ai-judges-your-face-and-tells-you-how-normal-you-are/)) &#x20;

### **Bias** &#x20;

The algorithms in the documentary classify and rate individuals based on the labelling of their training samples. Due to the manual labeling of training samples by individuals, the algorithms rely on subjective standards, making them susceptible to bias (European Commission, 2018; [Ref](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/jiang20a/jiang20a.pdf)).

For example, the training for the beauty algorithm was done exclusively by Chinese students who assigned beauty scores based on the traits they personally deem are most attractive ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). This subjective labelling process makes the beauty algorithm biased toward Chinese beauty standards ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). &#x20;

Besides this obvious potential for bias, beauty cannot be based on objective norms as perceptions of it vary globally. Nevertheless, algorithms are being used to classify and compare people. Dating websites, for example, assign people beauty scores based on the photos they upload, and then match them with people who have the same beauty score ([Ref](https://www.tijmenschep.com/how-normal-am-i/)).  &#x20;

The unjust implications of algorithms are not limited to the enforcement of subjective beauty standards. If the training data used to develop image or facial recognition models is biased or lacks diversity, it can lead to inaccurate and unfair results, disproportionately impacting certain demographic groups. This can result in discriminatory practices in areas such as law enforcement, surveillance, and hiring processes, reinforcing existing social biases and inequities ([Ref](https://www.brookings.edu/research/algorithmic-bias-detection-and-mitigation-best-practices-and-policies-to-reduce-consumer-harms/)).

### **Manipulation** &#x20;

Facial recognition algorithms are not only susceptible to bias but also to manipulation. For example, the age algorithm in _How Normal Am I?_ will falsely perceive an individual to be young if they shake their head ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). Moreover, manipulating certain factors such as lighting can influence the beauty score, while raising eyebrows can result in a lower BMI score ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)).&#x20;

The potential for inaccurate predications has broader implications. [Facial recognition algorithms](http://gendershades.org/) have been known to exhibit high rates of false positives and false negatives, leading to wrongful identification and potential harm to innocent individuals.&#x20;
