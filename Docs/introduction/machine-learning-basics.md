# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables a machine to learn without being explicitly programmed.

While machine learning has demonstrated remarkable potential, it is not without its challenges and concerns.

### _How Normal Am I?_

Follow this [<mark style="color:blue;">link</mark> ](https://www.hownormalami.eu/)to take part in an interactive documentary that demonstrates how facial recognition algorithms are used to judge people ([Ref](https://www.project-sherpa.eu/how-normal-am-i-nominated-for-best-eu-website-of-the-year/)). &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The AI models used in _How Normal Am I?_ have been modified to operate within a web browser ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). All data analysis occurs locally on your device, ensuring that no personal information is transmitted to the cloud ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)).

### 1. ML's Potential to do Good

ML involves the construction of mathematical models and algorithms that can analyze and interpret complex data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on the patterns discovered ([Ref](https://workshops.hackclub.com/teachable\_machine/)). Through iterative learning processes, machine learning algorithms can adapt and optimize their performance over time, enhancing their ability to handle new or unseen data ([Ref](https://workshops.hackclub.com/teachable\_machine/)).&#x20;

#### Machine Learning’s potential to do good &#x20;

Machine learning offers a wide range of benefits across various domains, such as: &#x20;

* **Data-driven insights**: Machine learning enables the analysis of complex data to extract valuable insights and patterns that may be difficult for humans to identify, leading to informed decision-making and improved outcomes.&#x20;
* **Automation and efficiency**: Machine learning automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and increasing productivity. It streamlines processes, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.&#x20;
* **Enhanced accuracy and precision**: Machine learning algorithms excel at tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, leading to higher accuracy and precision in various applications.&#x20;
* **Personalized experiences**: Machine learning enables personalized recommendations and experiences by understanding individual preferences, improving user satisfaction, and driving customer loyalty.&#x20;
* **Real-time fraud detection**: Machine learning algorithms can detect fraudulent activities by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data, providing real-time fraud prevention and safeguarding financial systems.&#x20;
* **Advanced healthcare diagnostics**: Machine learning aids in early disease detection and diagnosis by analyzing medical records, imaging data, and genetic information, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.&#x20;

* **Scientific advancements**: Machine learning contributes to scientific research by enabling data analysis, pattern recognition, and simulations, accelerating discoveries and breakthroughs in various fields.&#x20;

### 2. Bias & Manipulation in AI&#x20;

_How Normal Am I?_ was made by Tijmen Schep - an artist, technology critic, and privacy advocate - with the aim of provoking people to question the reliability of facial recognition systems and AI more broadly ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). &#x20;

The documentary uses a facial recognition algorithm to judge a person’s beauty, age, gender, body mass index, life expectancy, and other factors ([Ref](https://www.tijmenschep.com/how-normal-am-i/)). Facial recognition algorithms heavily rely on the training data they receive, which consists of manually labeled photos. &#x20;

_“If you have a low score, it might just be because the judgment of these algorithms is so dependent on how they were trained” -_ Tijmen Schep ([Ref](https://www.techjuice.pk/this-eu-funded-ai-judges-your-face-and-tells-you-how-normal-you-are/)) &#x20;

**Bias** &#x20;

The algorithms in the documentary classify and rate individuals based on the labelling of their training samples. Due to the manual labeling of training samples by individuals, the algorithms rely on subjective standards, making them susceptible to bias. &#x20;

For example, the training for the beauty algorithm was done exclusively by Chinese students who assigned beauty scores based on the traits they personally deem are most attractive ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). This subjective labelling process makes the beauty algorithm biased toward Chinese beauty standards ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). &#x20;

Besides this obvious potential for bias, beauty cannot be based on objective norms as perceptions of it vary globally. Nevertheless, algorithms are being used to classify and compare people. Dating websites, for example, assign people beauty scores based on the photos they upload, and then match them with people who have the same beauty score ([Ref](https://www.tijmenschep.com/how-normal-am-i/)).  &#x20;

The unjust implications of algorithms are not limited to the enforcement of subjective beauty standards. If the training data used to develop image or facial recognition models is biased or lacks diversity, it can lead to inaccurate and unfair results, disproportionately impacting certain demographic groups. This can result in discriminatory practices in areas such as law enforcement, surveillance, and hiring processes, reinforcing existing social biases and inequities. &#x20;

**Manipulation** &#x20;

Facial recognition algorithms are not only susceptible to bias but also to manipulation. For example, the age algorithm in How Normal Am I? will falsely perceive an individual to be young if they shake their head ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)). Moreover, manipulating certain factors such as lighting can influence the beauty score, while raising eyebrows can result in a lower BMI score ([Ref](https://starts.eu/article/detail/how-normal-am-i/)).&#x20;

The potential for inaccurate predications has broader implications. Facial recognition algorithms have been known to exhibit high rates of false positives and false negatives, leading to wrongful identification and potential harm to innocent individuals. &#x20;
