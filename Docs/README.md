# Intro to Kit

### Welcome to an activity on ethical Machine Learning (ML)!&#x20;

This activity is centered on a practical example of ethical use of AI - **Driver Distraction Detection (DDD) systems**.

At the end of this activity, you will: &#x20;

1. Acquire introductory machine learning knowledge.
2. Identify reasons behind bias in ML models.
3. Create a basic image classifier that can detect distraction.
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the created ML model.
5. Evaluate the implications of the created ML model  based on the principles for creating ethical AI.&#x20;
6. Make predictions and control physical components through a microcontroller (part of the optional component)&#x20;

### Prerequisite skills and hardware components required:&#x20;

1. Basic programming.&#x20;
2. A chrome-based browser such as Chrome, Edge or Brave. &#x20;
3. For the optional part of the activity you will need:&#x20;
   * Arduino compatible microcontroller such as the Raspberry Pi Pico or Arduino UNO.
   * A Micro-USB cable.
   * The latest version of Arduino IDE installed.
   * An Active [Buzzer](https://www.circuitbasics.com/what-is-a-buzzer/).
   * A [Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)&#x20;
   * Jumper wires.
