### Welcome to an activity on ethical machine learning!&#x20;

This activity is centered on a practical example of AI - **Driver Alertness Detection (DAD) systems**.

By following this guide, you will be able to: &#x20;

* Describe what DAD systems are and how they function. &#x20;
* Create a basic machine learning model that can detect alertness.
* Summarize principles for creating ethical AI.&#x20;
* Evaluate the accuracy and implications of DAD systems. &#x20;

### Prerequisite skills and hardware components required:&#x20;

* Basic programming.&#x20;
* A chrome-based browser such as Chrome, Edge or Brave. &#x20;
* For the optional part of the activity you will need:&#x20;
  * A microcontroller such as an Arduino.
  * A Micro-USB cable.
  * The Arduino IDE 2 installed.
  * An Active [Buzzer](https://www.circuitbasics.com/what-is-a-buzzer/).
  * A [Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all) and jumper wires.&#x20;
