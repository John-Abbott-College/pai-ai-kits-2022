# Intro to Ethical Machine Learning through a Practical Example

### Welcome to an activity on ethical machine learning!&#x20;

This activity is centered on a practical example of ethical use of AI - **Driver Alertness Detection (DAD) systems**.

At the end of this activity, you will be able to: &#x20;

1. Describe what DAD systems are and how they function. &#x20;
2. Create a basic machine learning model that can detect alertness.
3. Summarize principles for creating ethical AI models.&#x20;
4. Evaluate the accuracy and implications of DAD systems. &#x20;

### Prerequisite skills and hardware components required:&#x20;

1. Basic programming.&#x20;
2. A chrome-based browser such as Chrome, Edge or Brave. &#x20;
3. For the optional part of the activity you will need:&#x20;
   * A microcontroller such as an Arduino.
   * A Micro-USB cable.
   * The latest version of Arduino IDE installed.
   * An Active [Buzzer](https://www.circuitbasics.com/what-is-a-buzzer/).
   * A [Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)&#x20;
   * Jumper wires.
