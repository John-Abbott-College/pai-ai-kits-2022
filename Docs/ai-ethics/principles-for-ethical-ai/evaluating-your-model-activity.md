# Evaluating Your Model \[Activity]

## Overview&#x20;

The aim of this activity is for you to:&#x20;

* Consider the ethical implications of using your model in a real-life scenario&#x20;
* Think of ways to mitigate any potential harm your model could cause&#x20;

This is a group activity. First, assign the following roles within your group: **leader, notetaker, timekeeper,** and **presenter**. Then, respond to the scenario and evaluate your model accordingly.&#x20;

## **Scenario**&#x20;

Your model has gained widespread attention due to its potential to revolutionize the **delivery industry** by significantly reducing the number of accidents caused by driver negligence or fatigue. Delivery companies across the country are eager to adopt your technology, believing it will enhance road safety and improve the efficiency of their operations.

## Evaluation

Consider the broader implications of integrating your model into delivery trucks. Reflect on the ethical responsibilities involved in deploying such technology and explore possible solutions to ensure that safety, privacy, fairness, and transparency are upheld while maximizing the benefits of your innovation.

### Accuracy

First, discuss the accuracy of your model.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:purple;">How did your model perform?</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">Were there instances in which your model made inaccurate predictions?</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">What do you think caused these inaccuracies?</mark>

### Ethics

Then, choose one **ethical principle** to evaluate your model with:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Responsibility</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">What level of responsibility do you believe technology developers have in ensuring the ethical implications and consequences of their creations? Should there be a code of ethics specific to driver monitoring models? If so, what principles should it encompass?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">While the model aims to reduce accidents caused by human error, what happens when the model itself malfunctions or makes incorrect judgments? How can you address the possibility of false positives or false negatives that may lead to unfair penalties or compromised safety?</mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fairness</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How can you ensure that the model does not disproportionately affect certain individuals or groups, such as based on race, gender, or socioeconomic background? What steps can be taken to mitigate bias and discrimination in the model's decision-making process?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">Should drivers have the ability to contest or appeal the decisions made by the driver monitoring model? How can you strike a balance between providing drivers with agency and upholding safety standards?</mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transparency</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How can you make the decision-making process of the model transparent to both drivers and the general public? What mechanisms or explanations can be provided to ensure that the system's judgments are understandable and explainable?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How can you ensure transparency in how the data collected by the model is utilized? What measures can be implemented to inform drivers about the types of data being collected, how it will be used, and how long it will be retained?</mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Freedom</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How can the driver monitoring model strike a balance between enhancing safety and preserving the freedom and autonomy of drivers? Should drivers have the ability to disable or override the monitoring system in certain situations?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">Does the implementation of driver monitoring models raise concerns about freedom of movement and privacy, as it restricts or monitors drivers' actions? How can you address these concerns while ensuring road safety?</mark></td></tr></tbody></table>
