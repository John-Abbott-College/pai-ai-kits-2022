* <mark style="color:purple;">How did your model perform?</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">Were there instances in which your model made inaccurate predictions?</mark>

#### In your group, assign the following roles:

1. leader&#x20;
2. notetaker&#x20;
3. timekeeper&#x20;
4. presenter

**With your group, consider the following scenario:**&#x20;

A car manufacturer is interested in integrating your model into their new cars. It is crucial to consider the implications of an AI system, and to mitigate any potential harm it could cause, before putting it on the market. Consider the ethical implications of using your model in this real-life scenario. Try to think of ways to mitigate any potential harm it could cause.&#x20;

Choose one **ethical principle** to evaluate your model with:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Responsibility</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How might errors impact individuals, the car manufacturer, and other stakeholders?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">Who or what entity would be responsible if the model caused harm?</mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fairness</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">Are there particular groups that may be disadvantaged by the model?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How could you make your model more fair?</mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transparency</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">Can the general public understand how your model works?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">What would you have to do in order to make the model publicly understandable and auditable?</mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Freedom</strong></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How might the use of your model in cars impact people's freedom?</mark></td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How could freedom be better safeguarded?</mark></td></tr></tbody></table>
