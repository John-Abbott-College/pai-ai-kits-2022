Amazon is  deploying a system called Driveri in its delivery vehicles to continuously monitor drivers and report any perceived questionable actions to their supervisors (Ref). These actions encompass not only accidents but also behaviors such as tailgating, making U-turns, failure to wear seatbelts, obstructing the camera's view, sudden braking or acceleration, and indications of distraction or drowsiness as interpreted by the AI. If caught yawning, drivers are instructed to pull over for a minimum of 15 minutes, with non-compliance possibly resulting in a call from their supervisor. &#x20;

Concerns have been raised regarding privacy, with drivers describing the cameras as intrusive and akin to a punishment system. The use of AI monitoring raises accuracy and fairness concerns, as AI struggles to comprehend human behavior nuances and anomalies, potentially leading to errors in judgment. Furthermore, the refined AI capabilities may exert increasing pressure on drivers to conform their behavior, movements, and appearance to satisfy the demands of the surveillance AI system.&#x20;
