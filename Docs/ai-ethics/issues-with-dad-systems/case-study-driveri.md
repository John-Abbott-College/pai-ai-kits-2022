## Issues with Driveri

Concerns have been raised regarding **privacy**, with drivers describing the cameras as **intrusive** and akin to a **punishment** system. The use of AI monitoring raises accuracy and fairness concerns, as AI struggles to comprehend human behavior nuances and anomalies, potentially leading to **errors in judgment**. Furthermore, the refined AI capabilities may exert increasing pressure on drivers to conform their behavior, movements, and appearance to satisfy the demands of the surveillance AI system. For instance, if caught yawning, drivers are instructed to pull over for a minimum of 15 minutes, with non-compliance possibly resulting in a call from their supervisor. &#x20;
