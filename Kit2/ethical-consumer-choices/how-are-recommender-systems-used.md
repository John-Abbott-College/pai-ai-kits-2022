Recommends products to customers based on their past purchases, browsing history, or similar customers' preferences \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mde.3882)].&#x20;

Example: Amazon's "customers who also bought this item" feature \[[5](https://davidgaughran.com/also-boughts-amazon-recommendations/)].&#x20;

### <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Picture2.png" alt="" data-size="line"> Job Portals

Recommends suitable job postings to job seekers based on their skills, experience, and preferences \[[6](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/algorithms-in-e-recruitment-systems)].&#x20;

Example: LinkedIn's job recommendation feature \[[6](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/algorithms-in-e-recruitment-systems)].

### <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Picture3.png" alt="" data-size="line"> News & Content Aggregation

Recommends articles, blogs, and news items that match users' interests, encouraging them to spend more time on the platform \[[7](https://medium.com/@mashod0rana/a-brief-on-recommendation-system-a33ceb149f43)].&#x20;
