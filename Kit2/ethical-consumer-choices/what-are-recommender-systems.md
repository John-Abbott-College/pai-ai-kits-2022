# What Are Recommender Systems?

A recommender system is a complex algorithmic structure designed to provide suggestions to users within a predefined context \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)]. These systems use techniques rooted in information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, and statistics to produce outcomes \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)]. The main goal of recommender systems is to filter through large-scale information to predict and provide personalized recommendations, aligned with a user's specific needs or preferences \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)] \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mde.3882)].
