# Part 2 - Content-based and Collaborative filtering recommendations on notebook

In this part of the activity, we will create content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations. We will be using a Kaggle [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/meghrig/kit-3/) to complete this step.&#x20;

A Kaggle notebook is a cloud-based computational environment where users can execute code, analyze data, and share. Users can interact with Kaggle datasets and contests, have version control, and use team collaboration tools. Users can also "fork" open notebooks so they can build on and learn from the work of others.

To make content-based recommendations, product features in the highlights column will be used. To make recommendations based on collaborative filtering, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, which is a matrix factorization technique, will be used. Fork the notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions.

To fork the notebook:

1. Open the Kaggle notebook.&#x20;
2. Click on the three dot menu and select _**Copy & edit notebook**_&#x20;
