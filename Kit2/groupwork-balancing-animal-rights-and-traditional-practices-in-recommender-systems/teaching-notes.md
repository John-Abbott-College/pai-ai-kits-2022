# Teaching Notes

### **Overview**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="190"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Say</td><td>In this next exercise, you will focus on finding a balance between promoting animal rights and respecting traditional practices within the context of recommender systems. The exercise can help you to improve your critical thinking skills, empathy for different perspectives, and communication skills.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to read the <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/NzKApfSfEwdEjEg8yyOv/groupwork-balancing-animal-rights-and-traditional-practices-in-recommender-systems">instructions </a>for the exercise.</td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Split students into three groups (one group for each of the three stakeholders.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to go with their group to their starting station.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to read through the scenario and stakeholder profiles.</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

### **Brainstorming (students work at their stakeholder’s station)**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="187"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to deliberate and come up with two improvements for the recommender system based on their stakeholder’s interests.</td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Give students 20 minutes to brainstorm and come up with their improvements.</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

### **Rotations (students move around to the other stations and provide feedback)**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="181"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ask</td><td><p>Students to rotate to the next station and do the following:</p><ul><li>Read the previous group’s improvements</li><li>Discuss it from their stakeholder’s perspective</li><li>Write constructive feedback on the previous group’s improvements</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Give students 10 minutes to work at the new station.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to rotate to the next station and follow the previous steps.</td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>While students are working, move around the room and ensure groups are engaged and adhering to the exercise’s objective. Assist groups that might be struggling with formulating improvements or feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>Say</td><td><p><em>[Use the following information to help groups that are struggling]</em></p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Dual Rating System:</strong> Instead of a single 'Animal-Friendly' rating, CraftSphere could introduce a dual rating system. One rating would indicate the 'Animal-Friendly' score, and the other would denote a 'Cultural Heritage' score for products that uphold traditional crafting methods. This approach respects both animal rights and cultural traditions by allowing users to make informed choices based on their own values.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Information Transparency:</strong> For products that don't score high in the 'Animal-Friendly' category due to traditional practices, CraftSphere could provide detailed information about these practices. This can include explaining why specific materials are used, how the animals are treated, and the cultural significance of these methods. This would provide users with a fuller understanding of the ethical trade-offs and could help them make more informed decisions.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Balanced Promotion:</strong> CraftSphere could ensure balanced visibility for both 'Animal-Friendly' and 'Cultural Heritage' products in their recommendations. This could involve highlighting a mix of products on their homepage and in other high-visibility areas, or alternately featuring 'Animal-Friendly' and 'Cultural Heritage' products.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Artisan Support:</strong> CraftSphere could offer resources and support for traditional artisans who wish to explore more animal-friendly methods without losing their cultural heritage. This could involve connecting artisans with experts in sustainable and ethical crafting, offering grants for training or equipment, or hosting workshops on animal-friendly alternatives.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>User Education:</strong> CraftSphere could also run educational initiatives for users, exploring both the importance of animal rights and the value of preserving traditional crafts. This could help foster understanding and respect for both ethical causes among users.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Group Reflection**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="181"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Do</td><td>Once all rotations are complete, direct groups back to their initial stations.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Students to read through the feedback they received, discuss how to modify their improvements accordingly, and prepare a short presentation based on their modified improvements.</td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Give students 15 minutes to modify their initial improvements.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td>Each group to present their modified improvements to the rest of the class.</td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;

### **Reflection and Debrief**

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="173"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ask</td><td><mark style="color:purple;">Did advocating for a single principle effectively address the ethical dilemma? Why might a holistic approach be necessary when improving recommender systems?</mark></td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Give students 10 minutes to respond to the question, allowing at least one student from each group to share their responses.</td></tr><tr><td>Ask</td><td><mark style="color:purple;">How did the principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and trust manifest in your group's proposed improvements and the negotiation process? How might these ethical principles be balanced to create a recommender system that minimizes harm, promotes good, respects user autonomy, and fosters trust among all stakeholders?</mark></td></tr><tr><td>Do</td><td>Give students 10 minutes to respond to the question, allowing at least one student from each group to share their responses.</td></tr></tbody></table>
