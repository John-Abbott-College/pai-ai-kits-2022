# The Ethics of Recommender Systems

Evaluating recommender systems is not just about how accurate their predictions are. Anyone involved in the development or deployment of AI technologies must be mindful of the impact they can have. As we learned earlier, recommender systems have the potential to cause harm. To avoid doing harm, these systems must be developed and deployed with ethical principles in mind.

## Principles for Creating Ethical AI

### <img src=".gitbook/assets/Picture13 (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Non-maleficence

The principle of non-maleficence, an important cornerstone in creating ethical AI, dictates that we should "do no harm” \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)], \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)]. This concept, originating from healthcare ethics, is particularly significant in the context of AI and more specifically, recommender systems \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)]. Here, non-maleficence isn't just about preventing harm to individual users \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)]. It extends to safeguarding society as a whole from potential damage \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)], \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)].

This principle stipulates that AI systems should not cause harm that spans from individual level concerns like psychological well-being and personal data privacy, to broader societal issues like propagating misinformation, reinforcing biases, or contributing to data breaches \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)]. It embodies the idea that those who develop and design AI systems have a responsibility to prevent harm that may extend beyond individual users and ripple out into the wider society \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)].

<summary> <strong>Learn More – Applying the Principle of Non-maleficence to Identify Harm in Amazon's Recommender System</strong></summary>

Identifying potential harm caused by recommender systems is paramount in ensuring the ethical use and development of these technologies \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)], \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)], \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)]. Without proper oversight and understanding, the very mechanisms that make recommender systems effective can also make them potentially harmful \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)], \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)], \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)].

Let’s use the principle of non-maleficence to identify harms that Amazon’s recommender systems could potentially cause. Amazon’s recommender systems continuously suggest new products to users based on past purchases or viewed items \[[72](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344596537_Retailing_and_the_Ethical_Challenges_and_Dilemmas_Behind_Artificial_Intelligence)]. This could potentially lead to compulsive shopping behaviors \[[73](https://competition-forum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/art.-n%C2%B0-0019.pdf)], \[[74](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recommender-systems%3A-An-overview-of-different-to-Shah-Salunke/85ddc4a521ca177dc416e1954f4206d0d20b1d40)]. Features like "customers also bought" or "based on your browsing history" might create an endless cycle of browsing and purchasing, which can result in overspending and excessive consumption \[[73](https://competition-forum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/art.-n%C2%B0-0019.pdf)], \[[74](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recommender-systems%3A-An-overview-of-different-to-Shah-Salunke/85ddc4a521ca177dc416e1954f4206d0d20b1d40)]. This is an instance where the principle of non-maleficence should be considered, as the recommender system could be causing harm by contributing to unhealthy shopping habits \[[75](https://alahausse.medium.com/amazon-sets-new-sustainability-standards-actions-to-ease-availability-of-sustable-products-cc752526a77)].

Moreover, with its primary focus on generating profit, Amazon is likely to recommend products based on price, popularity, or user behaviour \[[73](https://competition-forum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/art.-n%C2%B0-0019.pdf)]. This can lead to the promotion of non-ethical products such as clothing items produced through exploitative labor practices, cosmetics tested on animals, food products linked to deforestation, or electronics manufactured under poor working conditions \[[76](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/amazoncom-inc)], \[[77](https://www.gallantintl.com/blogs/is-amazon-promoting-unethical-production)]. This practice not only harms the individual user by encouraging unsustainable consumption but also poses broader societal risks by supporting industries or companies that may not adhere to ethical business practices \[[76](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/amazoncom-inc)].

It's crucial for developers, policymakers, and users alike to recognize these potential pitfalls, as awareness is the first step towards mitigation and improvement \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)], \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)], \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)]. This is not only about correcting errors but also about fostering a culture of responsibility in the field of AI and recommender systems, where potential harm is identified, addressed, and minimized \[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)], \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)], \[[70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5)], \[[71](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14614448211022702)].

### <img src=".gitbook/assets/Picture14 (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Beneficence** &#x20;

Considering the extensive use of recommender systems, just avoiding harm is not enough. We also need to ask: are these systems having a positive impact? Are they improving society in any way? To truly create an ethical recommender system, it should also be made to follow the principle of beneficence \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)].

While non-maleficence is about avoiding harm, beneficence goes a step further by asserting that **the system should actively do good or provide benefits for users and society more broadly** \[[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2)]. For instance, a recommender system can suggest options that not only align with a user's interests but also promote the greater good \[[78](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360923024_Social_influence_for_societal_interest_a_pro-ethical_framework_for_improving_human_decision_making_through_multi-stakeholder_recommender_systems)].

**Recommending Ethical Consumption**

Recommender systems do not have to prioritize profit alone; they can be designed with broader ethical considerations and societal benefits in mind \[[72](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344596537_Retailing_and_the_Ethical_Challenges_and_Dilemmas_Behind_Artificial_Intelligence)]. There is a growing movement towards ethical consumption - making purchases based on considerations such as environmental sustainability, fair trade, labor rights, animal welfare, and social responsibility \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mde.3882)], \[[52](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264)], \[[72](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344596537_Retailing_and_the_Ethical_Challenges_and_Dilemmas_Behind_Artificial_Intelligence)]. This is where the principle of beneficence can come into play. While recommender systems may contribute to issues like compulsive shopping, they can also be utilized to encourage **ethical consumption** habits \[[72](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344596537_Retailing_and_the_Ethical_Challenges_and_Dilemmas_Behind_Artificial_Intelligence)] by:

* **Prioritizing Ethical Products:** Recommender systems can be designed to prioritize products that meet certain ethical standards \[[78](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360923024_Social_influence_for_societal_interest_a_pro-ethical_framework_for_improving_human_decision_making_through_multi-stakeholder_recommender_systems)] - \[[79](https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2023_rp/335/)]. For instance, they could recommend products that are environmentally friendly, made with fair trade practices, or from companies known for their social responsibility \[[80](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2011.01.164)], \[[79](https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2023_rp/335/)].
* **Educating Consumers:** Recommender systems could include information about the ethical implications of a product in their recommendations \[[52](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264)], \[[72](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344596537_Retailing_and_the_Ethical_Challenges_and_Dilemmas_Behind_Artificial_Intelligence)]. For instance, they could provide information about a company's carbon footprint or labor practices \[[72](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344596537_Retailing_and_the_Ethical_Challenges_and_Dilemmas_Behind_Artificial_Intelligence)].
* **Personalizing Ethics:** If a recommender system knows a user is interested in ethical consumption (perhaps by their search history or stated preferences), it could prioritize ethical products in its recommendations to that user \[[81](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201418)].

Renoon and Good On You are two platforms utilizing recommender systems to promote ethical consumption, particularly in the fashion industry [\[82\]](https://sanvt.com/blogs/journal/best-sustainable-fashion-apps). Renoon curates personalized shopping experiences for users [\[83\]](https://500.co/theglobalvc/renoon-is-unlocking-sustainable-fashion-for-online-shoppers/), [\[84\]](https://renoon.com/about-us). It tracks actions like browsing and purchasing to create unique user profiles [\[83\]](https://500.co/theglobalvc/renoon-is-unlocking-sustainable-fashion-for-online-shoppers/), [\[84\]](https://renoon.com/about-us). Based on these profiles, Renoon suggests products that not only match the user's style but also their ethical values [\[82\]](https://sanvt.com/blogs/journal/best-sustainable-fashion-apps) - [\[84\]](https://renoon.com/about-us). By promoting sustainable and fair-trade brands, it encourages users to contribute positively to society through their buying choices [\[82\]](https://sanvt.com/blogs/journal/best-sustainable-fashion-apps) - [\[84\]](https://renoon.com/about-us). Good On You rates thousands of fashion brands on their environmental impact, labor rights, and animal welfare [\[82\]](https://sanvt.com/blogs/journal/best-sustainable-fashion-apps), [\[85\]](https://goodonyou.eco/how-we-rate/), [\[86\]](https://goodonyou.eco/faqs/). It uses this data, along with users' browsing habits and past interactions with different brands, to provide recommendations [\[82\]](https://sanvt.com/blogs/journal/best-sustainable-fashion-apps), [\[86\]](https://goodonyou.eco/faqs/). Users can also set their ethical priorities – be it environmental sustainability, labor rights, or animal protection [\[86\]](https://goodonyou.eco/faqs/), [\[87\]](https://startsomegood.com/goodonyou). These preferences guide the recommendation process, meaning Good On You doesn't just recommend based on aesthetics or price, but also on ethical considerations [\[86\]](https://goodonyou.eco/faqs/), [\[87\]](https://startsomegood.com/goodonyou).

### **Challenges**

Despite this positive potential, there are several **challenges** for recommender systems in promoting ethical consumption such as:

* **Reliability of Information:** Recommender systems are only as good as the data they have access to [\[88\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335470473_Data_quality_in_recommender_systems_the_impact_of_completeness_of_item_content_data_on_prediction_accuracy_of_recommender_systems). If they don't have complete and accurate information about the ethical practices of each product or brand, their recommendations might not truly align with ethical consumption [\[88\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335470473_Data_quality_in_recommender_systems_the_impact_of_completeness_of_item_content_data_on_prediction_accuracy_of_recommender_systems), [\[89\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276483947_Information_systems_to_support_sustainable_consumption_and_sustainable_supply).
* **Complexity of Ethical Considerations:** [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264). Different users may have different ethical priorities, making it difficult for a recommender system to universally define what constitutes an ‘ethical product’ \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mde.3882)], [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990). For instance, one person might prioritize organic goods while another values fair trade. It's a challenge for a recommender system to cover all possible ethical preferences accurately [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990).
* **Commercial Interests:** Recommender systems are often employed by commercial platforms with the primary aim of increasing sales [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202), [\[3\]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mde.3882), [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264). There may be a conflict of interest in recommending ethical products if they are less profitable or popular [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202), [\[3\]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mde.3882), [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264).
* **Data Privacy:** To personalize ethical recommendations, recommender systems may need to collect more data about user values and preferences, which could raise privacy concerns [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y).
* **Overemphasis on Consumerism:** : By constantly recommending new products, these systems might unintentionally encourage overconsumption, which contradicts the ideals of ethical and sustainable consumption [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990).

<summary><strong>Learn More – Challenges with Renoon &#x26; Good On You</strong></summary>

Promoting ethical consumption through recommender systems, like the ones used by Good On You and Renoon, presents numerous challenges. Firstly, the reliability of these systems is questionable [\[92\]](https://www.panaprium.com/blogs/i/good-on-you). Good On You rates fashion brands on a scale from 1 to 5, based on their impacts on people, the planet, and animals, using publicly available information and classifying the brands into categories ranging from "We Avoid" to "Great" [\[92\]](https://www.panaprium.com/blogs/i/good-on-you).

However, the fact that Good On You's grading system relies solely on easily accessible and publicly available information highlights a significant limitation [\[92\]](https://www.panaprium.com/blogs/i/good-on-you). It can result in an oversimplified and potentially inaccurate representation of a brand's ethical standing [\[92\]](https://www.panaprium.com/blogs/i/good-on-you). Furthermore, the grading scale of 1 to 5 isn't nuanced enough to differentiate between brands that are at varying stages of sustainability [\[92\]](https://www.panaprium.com/blogs/i/good-on-you). Moreover, Good on You's brand evaluation process lacks comprehensiveness and consistency, leading to a subjective grading system that fails to accurately represent a brand's sustainability efforts [\[93\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17). Similarly, Renoon's badge allocation process and personalized feed curation methods are unclear, leading to doubts about the credibility of their recommendations [\[93\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17).

Ethical consumption is a complicated topic as there are numerous ongoing debates regarding what makes a product ethical or unethical [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990). This complexity can make it difficult for recommender systems to effectively guide consumers towards ethical consumption [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990). Adding to the complexity, these systems have to balance ethical promotion with commercial interests\[[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202)]. Good On You's mechanism of allowing users to set their "ethical preferences" is tied to its business model [\[93\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17). The recommendations are associated with affiliate links, which provide the company with a financial incentive for each purchase [\[93\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17). This commercial interest could potentially overshadow the goal of promoting ethical consumption [\[93\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17). The systems also tend to prioritize consumerism [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y). They continuously recommend new brands or products to users, which could contribute to excessive consumption and run counter to the principles of sustainability.

</details>

The various challenges that recommender systems face in promoting ethical consumption highlight the pressing need for respecting user autonomy in AI applications.&#x20;



### <img src=".gitbook/assets/Picture15 (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Autonomy**&#x20;

Autonomy, as a principle for creating ethical AI, means designing and implementing systems that respect and enhance individuals' ability to make independent decisions and choices [\[51\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355055846_Role_of_Instagram_Addiction_on_Academic_Performance_among_Turkish_University_Students_Mediating_Effect_of_Procrastination), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y). It emphasizes the need to empower users to maintain control over their interactions with AI systems and avoid situations where technology excessively or invisibly influences their behavior [\[51\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355055846_Role_of_Instagram_Addiction_on_Academic_Performance_among_Turkish_University_Students_Mediating_Effect_of_Procrastination), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y).

When it comes to recommender systems, respecting autonomy is both a challenge and a necessity [\[94\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326764247_Do_You_Trust_Me_Blindly_Factors_Influencing_Trust_Towards_a_Robot_Recommender_System), [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264). These systems make decisions on behalf of users, curating content or products based on their past behavior and predicted preferences [\[94\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326764247_Do_You_Trust_Me_Blindly_Factors_Influencing_Trust_Towards_a_Robot_Recommender_System), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y). On the surface, this seems helpful, but a lack of transparency and user control can lead to serious issues.

For example, users might find themselves receiving unwanted suggestions or being nudged towards certain actions without a clear understanding of why [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202), [\[65\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2959100.2959101). This lack of control can lead to frustration, dissatisfaction, and even manipulation, as the system may prioritize its objectives over the user's needs and preferences [\[65\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2959100.2959101), [\[94\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326764247_Do_You_Trust_Me_Blindly_Factors_Influencing_Trust_Towards_a_Robot_Recommender_System), [\[52\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445264), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y).

<summary><strong>Learn More – The Importance of Autonomy in Promoting Ethical Consumption</strong></summary>

For platforms like Renoon and Good On You, respecting user autonomy is as vital as promoting ethical consumption. However, several challenges they face can potentially infringe upon this principle.

Good On You, for example, allows users to set their ethical preferences, which is a positive step towards respecting user autonomy [\[92\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17), [\[93\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276483947_Information_systems_to_support_sustainable_consumption_and_sustainable_supply). But the platform's limited rating system, with only five grades and potentially subjective assessments, doesn't provide a complete picture [\[92\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17), [\[93\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276483947_Information_systems_to_support_sustainable_consumption_and_sustainable_supply). With the scant details provided about the core issues of each brand and the lack of accessible raw data, users might not have the necessary information to make truly informed decisions [\[92\]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14695405231166875?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17), [\[93\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276483947_Information_systems_to_support_sustainable_consumption_and_sustainable_supply).

Similarly, Renoon uses its recommender system to curate shopping options based on a user's past behavior and preferences [\[82\]](https://sanvt.com/blogs/journal/best-sustainable-fashion-apps) - [\[84\]](https://renoon.com/about-us). However, this method might limit the scope of a user's choices and thus affect their autonomy. The lack of clarity on how certain products gain badges or how the personalized feed is curated, coupled with the limited information available in the app about these processes, could hinder users from understanding the full context of their options [\[93\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276483947_Information_systems_to_support_sustainable_consumption_and_sustainable_supply).

</details>

### <img src=".gitbook/assets/Picture16 (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Trust**&#x20;

Trust is a fundamental principle for creating ethical AI [\[51\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2). It represents the requirement for AI systems to **operate in a manner that is transparent, reliable, and understandable to its users, thereby earning their confidence in its decisions and operations**[\[51\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y). Trust in AI involves users believing that the system will behave as expected and that it will act in their best interests without causing undue harm [\[51\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0088-2), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y).

From a user perspective, if trust is absent, they may feel uncertain about the system's recommendations and question the reliability of the information being provided [\[94\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326764247_Do_You_Trust_Me_Blindly_Factors_Influencing_Trust_Towards_a_Robot_Recommender_System). This can lead to hesitation or even refusal to follow the system's suggestions, ultimately defeating the purpose of having a recommender system in the first place [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990), [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202).

Like autonomy, trust plays a crucial role in ethical decision-making. If a recommender system is trusted, it can assist users in making decisions that align with their ethical beliefs, such as promoting ethical consumption [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y). Conversely, a lack of trust in the system's ability to make ethical recommendations could discourage users from making ethically conscious decisions [\[2\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3493202), [\[90\]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1629990), [\[91\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00950-y). Thus, establishing and maintaining trust is vital for recommender systems to effectively contribute to ethical consumption and other decision-making processes.
