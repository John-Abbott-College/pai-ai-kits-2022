# 2. Content-based

This approach is used when the site has some information about the user and can make recommendations that are more relevant to the user \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[13](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\&hl=en\&user=gj7ac04AAAAJ\&citation_for_view=gj7ac04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC)].

**Example**: Based on your liking of a specific movie, content-based recommender systems present a curated list of other movies that you might like \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)],\[[13](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\&hl=en\&user=gj7ac04AAAAJ\&citation_for_view=gj7ac04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC)]. The list is selected based on relevance or similarity to what users like in some aspects such as genres, sub-genres, channel, etc \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[13](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\&hl=en\&user=gj7ac04AAAAJ\&citation_for_view=gj7ac04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC)].

**Advantages:**

* **User-independence:** Content-based recommendation systems operate based on item characteristics rather than user behaviors, ensuring they remain unaffected by the data sparsity issue where users engage with only a limited selection of items or when user numbers are low \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)].

**Disadvantages:**

* **Limited diversity** : Content-based recommenders primarily focus on recommending items similar to those the user has already shown interest in (Pratama, 2023). This can lead to a lack of diversity in recommendations, potentially restricting the user's exposure to new and diverse items (Pratama, 2023). Also, all users who like item X will receive the same recommendation set \[[20](https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7)].
* **Over-specialization** : Content-based recommenders heavily rely on item attributes, which can result in over-specialization  \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[20](https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7)]. Users may receive recommendations that are too similar and fail to capture the broader range of their interests  \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[20](https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7)].
* **Feature engineering** : Building content-based recommenders often requires significant effort in feature engineering  \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[22](https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-content-based-filtering)]. Extracting relevant and meaningful features from items can be challenging, especially in domains with complex and unstructured data  \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)}, \[[22](https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-content-based-filtering)].
* **Limited ability to capture complex preferences** : Content-based recommenders might struggle to capture complex and evolving user preferences \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)]. While they can recommend items with similar attributes, they may miss out on understanding deeper user tastes or preferences that arise from a combination of various factors \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)].
* **Content ambiguity:** Content-based recommenders heavily rely on the accuracy and completeness of item attributes or content \[[22](https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-content-based-filtering)]. If the item data is inaccurate or insufficient, it can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant recommendations \[[22](https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-content-based-filtering)].
