## Prep <a href="#toc143897847" id="toc143897847"></a>

The following information is for an optional add-on that teachers can follow to introduce students to recommender systems in an interactive way. If time allows, teachers are encouraged to showcase different recommender system types and features on popular platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Indigo.

### **Materials Needed:**

* A computer or tablet with internet access.
* A projector or a screen-sharing tool to display the websites to the whole class.
* Accounts for Netflix, YouTube, Indigo, and other websites (if necessary).

### **Familiarize Yourself with the Websites:**

* Explore Netflix, YouTube, and Indigo.
* Ensure you know where to find the specific recommendation features you'll be highlighting.
* Watch a couple of movies or shows on Netflix or videos on YouTube to get personal recommendations that can be used as examples during the lesson.

### **Technical Setup:**

* Ensure that the computer or tablet to be used has an internet connection.
* Test the projector or screen-sharing tool to make sure it's working correctly.
* Check the sound, especially if you're going to play any video previews or trailers.
* Log into the accounts for each website beforehand, especially for Netflix which requires a subscription. Ensure that you’re not auto-logged into any personal accounts that might display private or inappropriate content.

### **Arrange Alternative Content:**

* In the event that a site is down or there are technical difficulties, have screenshots or videos of the recommender system features ready. This ensures the lesson can proceed even without live access to the websites.

### **Privacy and Permissions:**

* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use these sites, especially if accessing them requires bypassing any school network filters.
* If possible, use a dedicated school or educational account, especially for Netflix, to avoid showing any personalized recommendations from a private account.
* Clear browsing data or use incognito mode to prevent unwanted browsing history or recommendations from appearing.
