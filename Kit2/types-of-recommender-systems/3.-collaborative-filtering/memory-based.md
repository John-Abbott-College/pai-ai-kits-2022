# Memory-based

**Memory-based** approaches use values of recorded interactions between users and items in the user-item interaction matrix \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)]. The figure below illustrates how the user-item interaction matrix works \[[25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3556536)].



**User-Item Interaction Matrix**

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="302"></th><th width="90">User 1</th><th width="91">User 2</th><th width="89">User 3</th><th>User 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Soft Matte &#x26; Easy Liquid Lipstick</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Matte Velvet Lipstick</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Color Shifter Mini Eyeshadow Palette</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Fermented Sake Hydrating Spray</td><td></td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



The number in each cell represents the explicit or implicit rating that the user gives to a product  \[[25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3556536)]. Explicit rating is gathered by directly asking the user to rate their satisfaction score (1-5) for a specific item \[[25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3556536)]. Implicit rating is gathered by indirectly deriving from user behavior such as the number of minutes they watched a movie or how many clicks the user browsed through a product page \[[25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3556536)].

From the user-item interaction matrix, there exists two collaborative filtering methods to generate personalized recommendations for users: **user-based collaborative filtering** and **item-based collaborative filtering** \[[26](https://medium.com/geekculture/overview-of-item-item-collaborative-filtering-recommendation-system-64ee15b24bb8)].

### **User-based collaborative filtering**

This method uses the user-item interaction matrix, calculates **similarity between users** and **selects a group of similar users** accordingly \[[26](https://medium.com/geekculture/overview-of-item-item-collaborative-filtering-recommendation-system-64ee15b24bb8)]. Next, it generates recommendations based on that group \[[26](https://medium.com/geekculture/overview-of-item-item-collaborative-filtering-recommendation-system-64ee15b24bb8)]. Every user will get their recommendations based on what item they interacted with in the past, and this will lead to a different set of recommendations for each user unless they all like the same set of products \[[26](https://medium.com/geekculture/overview-of-item-item-collaborative-filtering-recommendation-system-64ee15b24bb8)].

### **Item-based collaborative filtering**

This method also uses the user-item interaction matrix, but instead of finding a group of similar users, **finds a group of similar items to the one the user likes and recommends it** \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[26](https://medium.com/geekculture/overview-of-item-item-collaborative-filtering-recommendation-system-64ee15b24bb8)].

&#x20;**Advantages**

* **No domain knowledge is necessary.** Collaborative filtering doesn't require domain knowledge since it relies on user interactions for recommendations  \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)].
* **Serendipity** : Collaborative filtering offers the chance of unexpected discoveries, overcoming the content-based algorithm's constraint by recommending items that may be outside a user's usual interests \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)].

**Disadvantages:**

* **Sparsity of data** : Memory-based CF suffers from the sparsity problem, especially in large datasets where the user-item interaction matrix is sparse \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)], \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[23](https://www.turing.com/kb/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system)]. This can lead to challenges in accurately identifying similar users or items and making relevant recommendations \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)], \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)}, \[[23](https://www.turing.com/kb/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system)].If the matrix is sparse, predictions will be poor \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)], \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[23](https://www.turing.com/kb/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system)].
* **Computational complexity** : As the number of users or items grows, the computation required to find similarities can become intensive \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)]. In large-scale systems, memory-based CF may struggle to handle the computational load efficiently \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)]. When we have a new user or item, the similarity computations should be repeated making the approach computationally expensive and unscalable \[[27](https://www.cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0607/recommend/recommender/memorybased.html)].
* **Lack of scalability** : Memory-based CF systems can become computationally expensive and memory-intensive as the number of users and items increases \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[28](https://vitalflux.com/recommender-systems-in-machine-learning-examples/)] This can limit their scalability for very large datasets \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[28](https://vitalflux.com/recommender-systems-in-machine-learning-examples/)].
* **Limited diversity** : Similar to other collaborative filtering methods, memory-based CF can suffer from a lack of diversity in recommendations \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[23](https://www.turing.com/kb/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system)]. Users may receive similar suggestions, reducing the exposure to a broader range of items \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[23](https://www.turing.com/kb/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system)]. Moreover, sometimes it is not possible to predict certain active users' preferences for specific items \[[27](https://www.cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0607/recommend/recommender/memorybased.html)]. This situation arises when the active user has no common items with any of the individuals who have rated the target item \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)], \[[23](https://www.turing.com/kb/collaborative-filtering-in-recommender-system)], \[[27](https://www.cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/0607/recommend/recommender/memorybased.html)].
* **Cold start problem for users** : Just like other collaborative filtering approaches, memory-based CF faces a cold start problem for new users who haven't provided any interaction data yet \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)], \[[15](https://zenodo.org/records/5574927)], \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)]. Without historical data, the system may struggle to find similar users and provide accurate recommendations \[[1](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_705)], \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)], \[[15](https://zenodo.org/records/5574927)], \[[18](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/)], \[[19](https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7)], \[[21](https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning/)].
