This approach is used when the site has some information about the user and can make recommendations that are more relevant to the user <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9985512">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recommender-Systems-Melville-Sindhwani/2ec03d77dab6242832079e345a83823aae3998dd">[7]</a>.  </td></tr><tr><td>Say</td><td>A major advantage of the content-based approach is its user-independence. Content-based recommendation systems operate based on item characteristics rather than user behaviors, ensuring they remain unaffected by the data sparsity issue where users engage with only a limited selection of items or when user numbers are low<a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/"> [8]</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7">[9]</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Say</td><td><p>There are several disadvantages to the content-based approach such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Limited diversity:</strong> Content-based recommenders primarily focus on recommending items similar to those the user has already shown interest in <a href="https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7">[10]</a>. This can lead to a lack of diversity in recommendations, potentially restricting the user's exposure to new and diverse items <a href="https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7">[10]</a>.  Also, all users who like item X will receive the same recommendation set <a href="https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7">[10]</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Over-specialization:</strong> Content-based recommenders heavily rely on item attributes, which can result in over-specialization<a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/"> [8]</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7">[10]</a>. Users may receive recommendations that are too similar and fail to capture the broader range of their interests <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/">[8]</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@feruzta/content-based-filtering-650a43018ae7">[10]</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Feature engineering:</strong> Building content-based recommenders often requires significant effort in feature engineering<a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/recommender-system-personalization/"> [8]</a>, <a href="https://maddevs.io/blog/recommender-system-using-machine-learning">[11]</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-content-based-filtering">[12]</a>.

While they can recommend items with similar attributes, they may miss out on understanding deeper user tastes or preferences that arise from a combination of various factors <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/recommendation-system-an-introduction-74733602e9b7">[9]</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Content ambiguity:</strong> Content-based recommenders heavily rely on the accuracy and completeness of item attributes or content <a href="https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-content-based-filtering">[12]</a>.
