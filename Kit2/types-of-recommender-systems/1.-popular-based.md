# 1. Popular-based

* This approach is used when a site does not have enough information about the user \[[13](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\&hl=en\&user=gj7ac04AAAAJ\&citation_for_view=gj7ac04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC)].
* Example: Top 10 in your country today in Netflix \[[13](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\&hl=en\&user=gj7ac04AAAAJ\&citation_for_view=gj7ac04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC)].

<summary><strong>Learn More – Popular-based Approach</strong></summary>

**Advantages**

* **No cold-start problem:** Popular-based recommender systems suggest items based on overall popularity rather than individual user history \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)]. Thus, they can provide recommendations for new users or items without needing personalized data, avoiding the cold start problem\[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)].

**Disadvantages**

* **Lack of Personalization** : These systems treat all users the same, recommending the most popular items without considering individual preferences \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)] – \[[15](https://zenodo.org/records/5574927)]. This can lead to less relevant recommendations for individual users \[[14](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-recommendation-systems-machine-learning)] – \[[15](https://zenodo.org/records/5574927)].

- **Popularity Bias** : These systems can contribute to a rich-get-richer effect, where popular items become more popular, while less popular items rarely get recommended \[[16](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-recommender-systems-6c66cf15ada)].

* **Repetition and Lack of Novelty** : Users may continuously encounter the same popular items, leading to less diverse recommendations and potentially decreasing user engagement over time \[[17](https://medium.com/the-beta-labs-tech-blog/managing-biases-in-recommender-systems-365bb290c828)].
