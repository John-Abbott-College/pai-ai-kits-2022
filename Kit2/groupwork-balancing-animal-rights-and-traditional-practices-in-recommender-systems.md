# Groupwork: Balancing Animal Rights and Traditional Practices in Recommender Systems

## **Overview**

### Aim

This exercise focuses on finding a balance between promoting animal rights and respecting traditional practices within the context of recommender systems. Instructions

1. **Familiarize Yourself:** Read the scenario and stakeholder profiles to ensure you have a foundational understanding of CraftSphere's current recommender system and the perspectives of each stakeholder.
2. **Group Up:** You will be divided into teams. Each team will start at one of the following stakeholder stations:
   * Users (Animal Rights Advocates)
   * Providers (Proponents of Traditional Practices)
   * System (CraftSphere Platform)
3. **Brainstorm at Your Station:**
   * Begin at your assigned station.
   * As a team, brainstorm two suggestions for improving CraftSphere's recommender system from the viewpoint of that specific stakeholder.
   * Appoint one member to write down your group's suggestion on the chart paper or whiteboard.
4. **Rotate to the Next Station:**
   * After the allocated time, move to the next station in sequence.
   * Start by carefully reading the recommendation provided by the previous group.
   * Discuss the suggestion among yourselves, considering both its strengths and potential pitfalls.
   * After your discussion, write down your feedback on the same chart paper or whiteboard.
   * Your feedback should address:&#x20;
     1. Aspects of the suggestion you find effective and why.&#x20;
     2. Potential challenges or oversights in the suggestion.&#x20;
     3. Any refinements or additions you believe would strengthen the recommendation.
5. **Continue Rotating:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your team has visited and provided feedback at all three stations.
6. **Reflect and Refine:**
   * Return to your initial station and review the feedback your recommendation received.
   * As a team, discuss the comments and decide on any changes you'd make to your original suggestion based on the feedback.
7.  **Class Discussion:**

    * Once all rotations are completed, we'll reconvene for a shared conversation.
    * Each group will present their refined recommendation and share reflections on the feedback process.
    * Be prepared to discuss the complexities of the stakeholder viewpoint you started with and the insights you gained from others.&#x20;



### **Scenario**

This exercise revolves around CraftSphere, a fictional online platform dedicated to offering ethically crafted goods. Showcasing everything from jewelry and knitwear to home décor and handcrafted soaps, CraftSphere connects shoppers with independent creators globally. Recently, the platform updated its Ethical Rating System (ERS) to feature an 'Animal-Friendly' rating. While many users commend CraftSphere for incorporating animal rights into their ERS, artisans utilizing traditional methods with animal-derived materials feel unfairly disadvantaged. These artisans fear reduced visibility and sales since users may favor products with higher ethical ratings.&#x20;

### **Stakeholders**

#### **Animal Rights Advocates (Users)**

These users appreciate CraftSphere's ethical consumerism stance and its new 'Animal-Friendly' rating. They support cruelty-free products and actively oppose any practices that exploit animals.

#### **Artisans (Providers)**

Artisans craft items using animal materials, honoring methods with deep cultural and historical significance. They advocate for respecting their practices as part of global cultural diversity, believing that tradition can coexist with ethical responsibility.

#### **CraftSphere (System)**

CraftSphere faces the challenge of aligning user and artisan needs with their ethical consumerism values. They must assess the impact of recommender system changes on sales, engagement, artisan inclusion, and their reputation.

**Aim**

* The exericse aims to cultivate critical thinking, empathy for different perspectives, and communication skills.
* **Note:** Remember, this exercise is as much about paying attention and understanding others as it is about suggesting your own ideas. The goal isn't to "win" but to collaboratively work towards an ethical and balanced recommender system. Approach each station with an open mind and respect for diverse perspectives.

**Animal Rights Advocates (Users)**

* These users value CraftSphere's commitment to ethical consumerism and regard the new 'Animal-Friendly' rating as a positive development. They believe that companies should take a stand against practices that harm animals and that consumers should have the ability to easily choose cruelty-free products. They champion cruelty-free products and often boycott or campaign against practices that exploit animals in any form.

**Artisans (Providers)**

* These artisans craft items such as leather handbags, bone jewelry, hand-woven woolen blankets, and feathered decorative items. These materials are sourced from animals, often using methods passed down through generations, reflecting the deep cultural and historical significance of their craft. They argue that their practices, including the use of animal-based materials, should be respected as part of global cultural diversity. While they acknowledge the importance of animal welfare, they believe that traditional methods can be conducted responsibly and ethically.

**CraftSphere (System)**

* CraftSphere is in a challenging position. They need to balance the diverse needs and expectations of their users and artisans, while also maintaining their commitment to promoting ethical consumerism. They must consider how changes to their recommender system might affect sales, user engagement, and artisan inclusion. They also need to weigh the potential reputational risks and benefits of their decisions.
