### Distraction is subjective

Distraction is a multifaceted state that cannot be fully captured by just one type of data ​\[35]​. What distracts one person may not distract another ​\[32]​, ​\[2]​.

## Data Types

There are four types of data used to study distracted driving, each type has its **advantages** and **limitations** \[35].

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Behavioural" %}
Visual data depicting position and movement of different body parts of drivers \[32]
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Self-assessment" %}
Data collected from self-report questionnaires or surveys that ask drivers to reflect on their driving behaviour and engagement in distracting activities \[34]
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Physiological" %}
Data collected through sensors placed on drivers' bodies including heart rate, brain activity, breathing rate, skin temperature, and eye movement \[34]
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Performance" %}
Data that are obtained indirectly from the driver by assessing their vehicle-related actions such as brake and steering behaviour \[32], \[34]
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Each type of data has its advantages and disadvantages ​\[35]​. For instance, data collected from self-assessment questionnaires can offer valuable insights, but they are based on drivers’ personal opinions and the subjectivity of this measure can lessen its reliability ​\[32]​. Likewise, physiological data, although valuable to the study of distracted driving, are susceptible to interference from various factors such as drivers’ muscle movements ​\[32]​.

Distraction is a multifaceted state that cannot be fully captured by just one type of data ​\[35]​. Most activities that divert a driver’s attention from the road and the task of driving tend to involve multiple, if not all, types of distraction simultaneously ​\[28]​. For instance, texting creates concurrent manual, visual, and cognitive distractions ​\[28]​. To add to this complexity, the four types of data - performance, physiological, behavioral, and self-assessment - may not always align with each other ​\[32]​. For example, a driver may feel fully focused on the road despite exhibiting behavioral signs of distraction. This discrepancy can result in a misalignment between the behavioral data collected from the driver and their self-assessment data ​\[32]​.

Alternatively, a driver can experience cognitive distraction without it being evident in their driving performance or detectable through physiological measures ​\[32]​. This exemplifies the subjective and complex nature of distraction. Current methods lack the capability to fully comprehend and identify the complexities involved ​\[35]​. The state of distraction is inherently unique to each person, as what may distract one individual might not have the same effect on another ​\[32]​, ​\[2]​. This subjectivity presents challenges when attempting to study or measure distraction accurately.
